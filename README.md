# CyberSyndicate-Audit

## We are using 4 kinds of child contracts

1. Layerzero code
2. Double protocol
3. Erc 2981 for royalties
4. Opensea filter registry that supports royalties specifically on opensea.

regarding implementation issue for erc 2981 contract. We have already used it in our all contracts and it worked properly and never had any issue.

2981 basically handles royalties on different marketplaces. We don't have specify on all of them except opensea.

The other 2 child contracts are LZ and double protocol and they have already been audited.
